    """Wrapper of MLP to support more specific DRL usage.

    For advanced usage (how to customize the network), please refer to
    :ref:`build_the_network`.

    :param state_shape: int or a sequence of int of the shape of state.
    :param action_shape: int or a sequence of int of the shape of action.
    :param hidden_sizes: shape of MLP passed in as a list.
    :param norm_layer: use which normalization before activation, e.g.,
        ``nn.LayerNorm`` and ``nn.BatchNorm1d``. Default to no normalization.
        You can also pass a list of normalization modules with the same length
        of hidden_sizes, to use different normalization module in different
        layers. Default to no normalization.
    :param activation: which activation to use after each layer, can be both
        the same actvition for all layers if passed in nn.Module, or different
        activation for different Modules if passed in a list. Default to
        nn.ReLU.
    :param device: specify the device when the network actually runs. Default
        to "cpu".
    :param bool softmax: whether to apply a softmax layer over the last layer's
        output.
    :param bool concat: whether the input shape is concatenated by state_shape
        and action_shape. If it is True, ``action_shape`` is not the output
        shape, but affects the input shape only.
    :param int num_atoms: in order to expand to the net of distributional RL.
        Default to 1 (not use).
    :param bool dueling_param: whether to use dueling network to calculate Q
        values (for Dueling DQN). If you want to use dueling option, you should
        pass a tuple of two dict (first for Q and second for V) stating
        self-defined arguments as stated in
        class:`~tianshou.utils.net.common.MLP`. Default to None.

        Please refer to :class:`~tianshou.utils.net.common.MLP` for more
        detailed explanation on the usage of activation, norm_layer, etc.
